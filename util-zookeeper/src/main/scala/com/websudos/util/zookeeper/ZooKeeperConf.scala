 * This is a ZooKeeper client store for accessors using ZooKeeperConf traits to read/write from ZooKeeper.
 * Its sole purpose is to centralise access to ZooKeeper hosts and not necessitate access to multiple clients.
 *
 * Using a single global client object with a synchronized access pattern and just-in-time init we can solve the problem of localhost Mesos based deployments.
 * In a Mesos environment the ZooKeeper host is always fixed and every client application can easily talk to the same node to obtain data.
 *
 * Users can easily override all the default implementation details and assumptions this store has and roll out their own communication instance with
 * ZooKeeper. For now, this is mostly tailored to our Mesos deployment mechanism.
 *
